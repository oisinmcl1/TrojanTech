This script assists in gathering the hardware hash of devices during the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) process, which is essential for registering devices with Microsoft Intune's Autopilot service (for MOWI).


Instructions for Obtaining Hardware Hash:

Access Command Prompt: During the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) setup process of your Windows 11 device, press Shift + F10 to open the Command Prompt.

Insert the USB drive: Insert this USB drive into the device's USB port.

Run the script: In the Command Prompt window, navigate to the USB drive (D:) using the command D: and press Enter. Then, run the CMD file named GetAutoPilot.cmd by typing .\GetAutoPilot.cmd and pressing Enter.

Wait for completion: Allow the script to run and gather the hardware hash. Once the process is complete, a CSV file named compHash.csv will be generated on the USB drive.

Remove the USB drive: Safely remove the USB drive from the device.

Email the CSV file: Locate the CSV file named compHash.csv on the USB drive. Email this file to the administrator responsible for device registration (MOWI?).
